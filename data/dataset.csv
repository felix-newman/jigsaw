Comment: Maybe true, but that's very short-sighted. The lawsuits are already in the hundreds though on this. He's going to be getting sued six ways to sunset for his entire term. The Constitution offers very broad protection and it extends very far. Trump has no concept of what is involved.

He needs a judge that is a flexible Constitutionalist, not a literal one, because he's definitely going to bending the Constitution around in the next years. He's already started.

Every man at this point will automatically assume she wants to have sex and it might take a little foreplay for her to completely go through with it. We dont even know the full story, yet sexual assault is already being thrown at this man who clearly asked her after ""whats wrong"" and stopped.

I echo others that you need to get into therapy for your own mental health and wellbeing.

1) No; preaching thoughts in public that aren't socially acceptable isn't a crime, you moron. It's perfectly legal to do provided you're in compliance with local regulations regarding permits and noise and what not.

Saying things that aren't socially acceptable does not count as disturbance of the public order; and is in fact a fundamental right enshrined in the Dutch constitution. 

Freedom of speech means having the right to say things that you, or even nobody, wants to hear.

2) The man spews lies like a lawn sprinkler. I simply don't trust him.

Comment: Obviously he should have told you about this before you guys got serious. What he did was wrong and you should go get tested for your peace of mind.

That said, if he is being treated for HIV his viral load would probably be low to undetectable. Having unprotected sex with him would be safer than someone who has HIV but is undiagnosed. Also, if you are someone who is looking for casual sex, it is on you to make sure to take precautions.

Comment: I think the sound distance analysis came from you and it matched the SMARF building as a possible origin for a bullet quite well - taken that and the sudden occurrence of the incident, the fact that no apparent heat source was in the installation and the very bright glow in the first picture frame of the explosion I think sabotage matches these facts quite well - that would be enough to win a murder case for a state attorney but maybe without direct proof not enough as allegation in this case

1) One of my mentors keeps about $ in $ bills and always makes sure to cross in crosswalks. He hopes that either : He will pay for gas or some other item with $ bills, have the attendant think they are fake and detain him, and then have the local cop think they are fake and spend the night in jail. Easy pay out (supposedly) or : Get hit by a car while in the crosswalk and get a payout that way.
Answer: Yes

2) Cut the head off you cat. Leave it in his bed at night. Wake up early and tell your parents the whole story. When he comes out with the cat head they will obviously think it was him who decatitated muffins and bam! No more dealing with brother.

Comment: I disagree with the others. You damaged it, so it's up to you to pay it, or risk losing that friendship. $ isn't that much in damage. What car does your friend have? I assume it's a Yukon, but what year and trim? Call a junkyard and ask what the same year and color door would cost from there, I'd bet that it's reasonably cheaper, but it won't be exactly paint matched. Also, try a second opinion.

That said, in the tech industry, if they wined and dined OP, they're fine. Everyone knows that things like compensation packages are a little bit of a grey area - the background check is more of a check that the person actually worked at the places they say they worked.

Comment: A bit about this: While it certainly is morally reprehensible for the teacher to fuck a thirteen year old student, it was still an act he at least semi-consented to if not fully able. It was not traditional power fantasy forced upon rape. So in some way or another, as long as someone doesn't justify the sex, they can still describe it as such. Rape is a more twisted variant of sex. It is some form of sexual act.

Comment: It is certainly advisable for her to obtain an attorney. From the very start of the case there are certain steps that need to be taken. The other drivers insurance company will look at this as an opportunity to save money by settling quick. They will offer an amount that seems reasonable and most people jump at the offer. If you have not already spoken to an attorney please do so as soon as possible.

Comment: Here's how to not get soft banned while using a GPS spoofer:

. Turn on GPS spoofer before opening pokemon GO
. Stay in your city (honestly there's enough pokemon in your city to start with, don't get greedy and travel to New York or something in search for better pokemon)
. Only travel block at a time (moving too quickly will result in a soft ban, but it will also decrease your chances of discovering pokemon

If you follow these steps you shouldn't ever be soft banned again :)

The other drivers insurance company will look at this as an opportunity to save money by settling quick. They will offer an amount that seems reasonable and most people jump at the offer. If you have not already spoken to an attorney please do so as soon as possible. 

Good Luck and I wish your girlfriend well!

Comment: that is more or less a binding agreement

Employment in the US is trivial to terminate for anything other than protected reasons (e.g. race, religion), so don't think of offers as binding.

That said, in the tech industry, if they wined and dined OP, they're fine. Everyone knows that things like compensation packages are a little bit of a grey area - the background check is more of a check that the person actually worked at the places they say they worked.

If you are indeed suggesting legislation be put forth to exempt murder where rape is involved, it could present a lucrative business opportunity.

But...it's a little hard to do it that way because you filed a report and if he does get fucked up, they'll probably tie it to you.

Comment: Selling insurance is different from selling everything else. Insurance is one of the most expensive things people buy and they can’t see it, touch it, or hold it. You’re selling ideas. You’re selling trust. You’re selling promises. You’re selling yourself. This is such a huge challenge that most insurance salespeople quit in the first years and many agents are afraid to hire inexperienced salespeople.http://realhouseinsurance.blogspot.com

1) She might want to go stay with her folks for a little while. Turkish men beat the shit out of their girlfriends for far less than this. It's not out of line to say that she is legitimately in danger for this.
Answer: Yes

2) I'm of the opinion that beating your girlfriend as an impulsive reaction shouldn't raise as much question of moral character when compared to beating a cat, which requires inhibiting yourself from impulsively beating your wife but then deciding to exhibit physical aggression anyway on an unrelated party (cat).

Comment: No idea about NY, but in Texas it is not technically a crime, nor would it meet the definitions of trespass to chattel in Texas because you have no real damages.

Maybe, by a big stretch, it could be a violation of the Texas Health and Safety code regarding disposal of solid waste, but either a civil or criminal prosecution must be brought by a county or district attorney.

Best solution: Wait till you see them again and retaliate with water balloons.

Not legal advice, simply hilarious.

Examples:
1) Oh look, a stupid person!

If you're talking about the US, the states that do recognize common law marriages all require parties to have a marriage agreement and stated intent.

Answer: Yes

2) Obviously he should have told you about this before you guys got serious. What he did was wrong and you should go get tested for your peace of mind.

Comment: Seems stupid to me personally. A person can get in a car and ""recklessly endanger"" without attempting to kill someone. Just because someone is likely to get hurt doesn't mean that one is attempting to do it.

The idea that ""could not have not known"" is used to side-step intent is a bad legal practice. Burden of proof needs to be high, and intent matters.

Comment: You're right, sexual abuse does ruin lives, particularly when it comes from somebody who you should be able to trust.

This is why I am not advising OP to just ignore it. I think that OP should have a serious conversation with his father in which he and his sisters lay out that it needs to stop and exactly why. If it continues after that, then outside intervention is probably needed.

What course of action do you recommend, might I ask?

Comment: First, call EVERY divorce lawyer you can get your hands on. The best ones.
My mother told me that during her divorce, she learned that lawyers can't take a case if they have already heard from or turned down the other party. That's what my mom said. But I don't really know if that's true. Still, it doesn't hurt. I think you'd have a fairly good case.

Comment: It was a mistake involving the police because they don't give a shit about this issue. The only way you have a chance to get 'justice' is to do exactly what your girl did and snoop around. Spy on his bitch ass. Knock if door in, bust his mouth and get your stuff. He most likely won't call the cops because he's a criminal. But...it's a little hard to do it that way because you filed a report and if he does get fucked up, they'll probably tie it to you.

Try switching the genders. If a year old girl was pressured into sex by a year old man you would probably call it rape.

Comment: Here's how you do this, since people are offering up such silly advice as ""take her to a jewelry store"" or whatever. My method is simple and effective. Go to a jewelry store by yourself. They will have ring sizers there. Steal and/or buy one. Call up that one shady friend you have. You know the one. Buy rohypnol from him. Slip it into her drink when she isn't suspecting. Use the ring sizer to find her size. When she wakes up, she will be none the wiser.

2) rape has a victim. This was something that was my fault completely, a situation I put myself into. Yeah she was , and I was , but even at that age, I shouldn't have been such a dumbass.

Try switching the genders. If a year old girl was pressured into sex by a year old man you would probably call it rape.

Comment: While I completely understand why you don't want the baby you still have to consider the father. It's a tough one. If you don't have the money for an abortion but perhaps consider adoption. There are a lot of couples that want but can't have kids. I'm not sure if there's a cost to it but it may be worth finding out. Most of the time the adopting couple will pay for your medical expenses etc. The only trick would be to get the father to relinquish his parental rights.

Comment: Arbitration can cover more than just PR, nimrod. It is specifically used to undermine your ability to take a company to court. Sexually harassed at work? Arbitration. Wage dispute? Arbitration.

And, by the way, employers don't GIVE you anything, its a return on the work you provide for them. (Which will consist of most the hours of your working life.)

Comment: Don't get out of the house, he did nothing wrong. Kick the lying bitch wife out of the house or he risks losing it in the divorce.

When this goes to court, if the company doesn't settle, it will be crucified in court.

Comment: Going to the police (as a man) to report sexual assault is generally a bad idea. Women are almost never arrested for sexually assaulting men. The cops either laugh it off or, worse, if they do confront the woman about it she can lie, claim that he assaulted her and then he can end up in jail. 

It's hard to imagine a larger lose-lose criminal justice scenario for a male than to be sexually assaulted by a woman.

Rule: No legal advice: Do not offer or request legal advice.
Canonical Definition: [LEGAL ADVICE]

Examples:
1) OP, you need to get the fuck away from your boyfriend and his friend. This was RAPE. You said stop, your scumbag boyfriend told his friend not to, what the fuck is wrong with them? And If he thinks having a threesome is SO degrading, why did he agree to do it in the first place? And HE was the one who arranged the whole thing. I don't know the laws in your country but releasing your intimate photos to internet without your permission is a felony, you should immediately contact the police!
Answer: Yes

2) Then why are you here?

If you've really made your decision, check out the [Final Exit Network](http://www.finalexitnetwork.org/) they can help you exercise your right to self determination. Otherwise stop posting about having made your decision, trying to bait people into giving you pity. If you're so fucked up all you have left is random internet strangers giving you condescending and patronizing advice then you should probably off yourself.

He needs a judge that is a flexible Constitutionalist, not a literal one, because he's definitely going to bending the Constitution around in the next years. He's already started.
Answer: Yes

2) I'm of the opinion that beating your girlfriend as an impulsive reaction shouldn't raise as much question of moral character when compared to beating a cat, which requires inhibiting yourself from impulsively beating your wife but then deciding to exhibit physical aggression anyway on an unrelated party (cat).

Examples:
1) Please see 'legal name fraud' which you can research if the American police state government hasn't blocked it yet! They cannot touch you if you reject the slave name handed to you when you were a new-born baby. The IRS is an agency of the IMF, a foreign entity. IRS rules apply to persons not humans. As a human, you are free from all government rules and regulations: but if you consent to represent the NAME then you are their servant and slave, and must pay up.
Answer: Yes

2) Da fuck? No, in this case, this particular spate of killings is motivated by dissimilar cultures rejecting one another, and that's not my fault. I had literally nothing to do with any of this, I'm just objective enough to say that if you settle in a hardline country, expect backlash. Myanmar is not Berkely. Islam says to kill these people, so you're going to have to expect them to reject it in some very clear way.

Comment: i think we need to stop saying that sexual abuse is necessarily bad. i actually feel ""abuse"" is a relative concept. it really depends on what a girl gets used to. if you look at porn or amateur sex videos, much of what the guy does is rough and abusive, but convention tells a girl to enjoy it. same for sexual abuse of thai girls -- teach them well and in the end they enjoy it. then it is no longer abuse of any sort. in fact, every virgin gets abused during her first penetration.

Comment: There's no way anybody could prove that they married for that purpose unless OP told an immigration officer. I'm aware that marrying to keep somebody in the US is immigration fraud. What I'm saying is that they are supposedly in a real relationship for several years, and that immigration would have no way of knowing they just didn't want to get married for love. There is totally a grey area when immigration when two people involved are in a real relationship to begin with.

Answer: Yes

2) that is more or less a binding agreement

Employment in the US is trivial to terminate for anything other than protected reasons (e.g. race, religion), so don't think of offers as binding.

That said, in the tech industry, if they wined and dined OP, they're fine. Everyone knows that things like compensation packages are a little bit of a grey area - the background check is more of a check that the person actually worked at the places they say they worked.

Comment: Please see 'legal name fraud' which you can research if the American police state government hasn't blocked it yet! They cannot touch you if you reject the slave name handed to you when you were a new-born baby. The IRS is an agency of the IMF, a foreign entity. IRS rules apply to persons not humans. As a human, you are free from all government rules and regulations: but if you consent to represent the NAME then you are their servant and slave, and must pay up.

They only need to offer you an accommodation if available.

2) that is more or less a binding agreement

Employment in the US is trivial to terminate for anything other than protected reasons (e.g. race, religion), so don't think of offers as binding.

That said, in the tech industry, if they wined and dined OP, they're fine. Everyone knows that things like compensation packages are a little bit of a grey area - the background check is more of a check that the person actually worked at the places they say they worked.

2) Da fuck? No, in this case, this particular spate of killings is motivated by dissimilar cultures rejecting one another, and that's not my fault. I had literally nothing to do with any of this, I'm just objective enough to say that if you settle in a hardline country, expect backlash. Myanmar is not Berkely. Islam says to kill these people, so you're going to have to expect them to reject it in some very clear way.

Comment: CA is an at fault state so they will not be able to recover anything from your policy/you unless you were found to be at fault.

I'm not certain I agree with this point fully. The resulting civil suit would not be directly related to any of CA's road laws; while not being at fault is evidence in OP's favor, other factors could potentially sway the jury enough since it's not a matter of Reasonable Doubt.
